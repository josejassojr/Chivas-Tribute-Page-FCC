    <h3> Who are "Las Chivas"? </h3>
    <p class="text"> Las Chivas are a Mexican soccer club founded in 1906 in the city of Guadalajara in the state of Jalisco, Mexico. It is the most popular club in all of Mexico due in part to their tradition of only playing Mexican players on their team. They are the only team in Mexico to do so and have had great success throughout their history, being one of the most decorated teams in all of Latin America. Their iconic red and white striped shirts were adopted from Belgian club Club Brugge at the time of their founding. They have contributed many great players to the national team and players who have gone on to play in big clubs in Europe as well including: Omar Bravo, Javier Hernandez, Francisco Rodriguez, Carlos Salcido, and Carlos Vela amongst many others. </p>

    <h3> What Chivas Means To Me
    </h3>
    <p class='text'>I have always been a Chivas fan. I think the earliest I can remember watching a Chivas game would have to be when I was around five or six years old. They were the first soccer team I remember watching play. I remember watching them play every Saturday or Sunday with my dad who had the biggest influence on me becoming such a fan.

    <h3>A little bit about myself!
    </h3>
    <p class='text'> My name is Jose Jasso Jr. This is my first website. I am hoping to get better at creating responsive websites and hopefully later move on to creating web apps and maybe even iphone apps one day. But for now I'm getting some run in creating these.
